# Let the user input a string
user_input = str (input ("Input a string: "))

# Create a variable that has empty strings
# Create a for loop with range of user's length input
# Use if-elif-else to check each character written by the user
# Replace the string punctuation with the equivalent vowels and add each character using +=
# If the character is not a punction then proceed to else
